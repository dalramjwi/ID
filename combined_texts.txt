Once upon a day, three pigs were enjoying there day. They are new to this world, but didn’t know of a big beast. He stakes the woods waiting for his prey. The first pig moved some hay to build a digital house. One digital night, a digital wolf came prowling. He was big and bad all over. He came up with the most evilest ideas, sometimes working. He knocked silently and growled’’ Pig let me warm my tail. It got burned in a fire.’’ The digital pig was not buying it and oinked back’’ Never. Wolves are so scary.’’ That was very true about the wolf staring him down. He howled back’’Then your getting bomb young son. Come join the fun inside my coat.’’ He then pulled out a bomb and killed the piggy. He then covered him and howled‘’Comfortable little pig.’’ The wolf goal was to get every animal recorded in his coat. If he could, the world would burn. His coat was a long comfortable hoodie. He just hated that word. The next digital piggy was a unique one. He knew of such beast, yet never talked about him. He tried to replicate his jacket, but always failed. He build a house of oak sticks. The wolf came running up, thinking of his new clothes. He knocked softly and growled’’Piggy, let me in. If not, I will delete your house and you.’’ The piggy didn’t want to be deleted from earth. He shook his head no. The wolf hacked the pig and deleted him. He then deleted the house. The beast felt great power. He ran to the last house. It was a hacked house, scaring the wolf. He tried all his tricks but nothing happened. The pig hacked his coat and stole it. The piggy put the hood up, he grew instantly stronger. The wolf was very scared, his pack was his family. Then the pig died. The computer was apparently dead. The wolf and pigs were a part of a new game. A very deadly one. This world will be full of wolves.
The Airbus 320 (320) V1 was flying high above the soft blue sky that resembled a calm sea. Enjoying the beautiful view, Manya noticed something like a scooter under the left wing of the plane, drawing a path in the distance. A silver-coloured plane, ripping the heavenly ocean. Gathering speed, the strange jet caught up with the Airbus 320 and continued forward, just below its wing.
The sky was still blue and without stars, without sun, without a moon.
The two planes moved parallel to each other, without worries, like birds flying freely and beautifully.
Slight engine noise was drifting in the aeroplane cabin, flat, lulled. The sky “spoke”—a world of clouds began to change from blue to white, from white to charcoal grey, until they completely covered the silver plane. Manya was seated at the very back seat, 30A, and she was looking for the silver plane, but it seemed to sink into one of the clouds. Her gaze jumped from cloud to cloud, but there was no sign of the metallic silver bird. The girl did not dare to ask any of the passengers about the silvery bird flying nearby. She had a photographic memory, and she had sealed every detail of the plane—from the sharp nose of the plane and its thin elongated wings, up to the similar of a curved back of a fish. She kept her mobile phone firmly in her hands after she managed to take a photo through the small window of the plane from her seat 30A.
The landing was soft, like a feather touching the ground early in the morning. A cool sea breeze stroked the matte skin and scattered the dark-brown hair of the teenage girl who had arrived in her hometown. The taxi stopped in front of a metal gate with chess squares drawn on it. Satisfaction was written on Manya’s face, and a tiny thrill grew, almost like a childish sensation.
The smell of hyacinths, as well as the colourful blooming violets, filled her heart with joy and love for everything in this yard, in this house.
The news on the television at ten a.m. was full of the usual reports of politicians, frauds, hospitals, and wars. “BREAKING NEWS” appeared as red-coloured subtitles on the TV screen. Then a message followed: “An unidentified plane was spotted at two-thirty this morning parallel to an Airbus 320. When Earth Control tried to contact their crew, the plane vanished without any trace.”
The girl shuddered; her gaze froze on the TV screen. She had her favourite drink of hot milk with cocoa, grabbed her cell phone, and rushed out toward the observatory. There, the professor’s warm eyes looked at her curiously.
“I know why you are here so early,” the professor said. “I heard the news, but I’m waiting for you to tell me what happened.”
Manya embraced the old man, handed him a box of chocolates—his favourite, cherries with liquor. Her little fingers tapped the screen of the Android phone impatiently, searching for the picture of the silver plane. She bit her lip when she saw that the picture she took didn’t show the strange silver plane but a big, grey cloud.
“But I saw this strange aeroplane,” Manya said, confused. “A metal machine with a sharp muzzle, thin wide wings, and a body with a curved back like of a fish.”
The professor followed the story of his student, approached his desk, and switched on his hand-assembled laptop. All his students knew the password, “Eureka 007.” His eyes stared with anxiety, and he tapped nervously on the keyboard. He opened files until he eventually came to a file called “Phoenix.” A picture appeared—it was the one that Manya had taken with her Android phone from her seat 30A while watching through the aeroplane window. The beautiful silver aircraft filled the screen.
The professor turned on the projector-lights so stars and constellations were on the ceiling of the planetarium. Manya glanced at the gleaming outlines, stars she already knew and studied with interest.
“You must be wondering how the picture from your phone has appeared on my laptop,” the professor said quietly.
Manya approached the telescope, glanced at scrawled sheets of notes around it with handwritten dates and times.
“Yes, that’s right,” the professor said. “I followed an object with strange movements in the last month with the telescope. It was always at two-thirty in the morning. I recorded everything and the sudden disappearance of the silvery object. I figured you were flying on the late flight at the same hour this strange object appeared every morning. I used a signal from the satellite Phoenix. Phoenix was sent into the universe by a group of scientists a quarter of a century ago. I manipulated its signal to record everything from your Android phone to my laptop. It was at two-thirty in the morning that I saw the photo you had taken from the plane. Your advantage is that you saw this plane with your eyes, and I saw it through the photo.”
The professor turned on the huge television on the wall as if in a portrait gallery.
Manya glanced at the screen below the starry “sky,” when her favourite spokesperson for the weather forecast appeared. “So breaking news in the weather forecast, there will be something between rain and snow, silver lights in the blue sky, and our ‘Earth Control’ services will not be able to detect it…”
It was followed then by a child’s drawing on the weather forecast screen: a silver plane with a sharp muzzle, thin wings, and a fish-like back. “This is a passenger’s drawing from the Airbus 320 aeroplane. The passenger drew the unidentified aeroplane you heard about in our breaking news. So, expect a silver breeze and a fresh march.” The synoptic ended with his usual sense of humour.
Manya looked at the professor. “You have a new student, Professor—the young artist from the plane Airbus 320.”The laptop signalled, and the drawing of the young artist appeared on the screen.
There was once a mother mice who had seven mice. One day she told them ‘’ You are all old enough to go in the world, but be careful of the wicked coyote.’’ The mice knew how bad the coyote was. They were told he has tricks and killed their father. The first mice a dumb one, built a house of sand. Walking in the heat was a evil beast, he wore a ripped red hoodie, red bandanna and always was hungry. It was the wicked coyote looking for some meat. He went to the door and sneakily said ‘’ Mr mice, can you let me in’’ the mice said ‘’ Not by the tail am I letting you in.’’ The coyote exclaimed ‘’ Then I will huff and puff and blow your house off’’ so he huffed and puffed and blew the house down. He gobbled up the mice in one whole. He said ‘’ What great meat this is, hopefully their is more’’ and walked on. The second mice a little smarter built a house out of cactus. The coyote came running and use his magic to become a wolf. The now wolf loudly said ‘’ Little mice can you let me in it is really hot out here’’ the mice denied it by saying ‘’ You are the coyote so no.’’ This got the coyote mad and exclaimed this ‘’Then your house is gone’’ and blew the house down. He gobbled up the mice whole. The third mice built a house of sticks. The coyote came and used his magic to become a vulture. He said this ‘’ Little mice, can you let my poor legs in.’’ The mice said ‘’ No, you are the coyote’’ The now coyote said through the window’’ You will regret this.’’ He went through the window and gobbled up the mice.’’ Very tasty indeed.’’ The fourth mice built a house of brick. The wicked coyote became a fellow mice he said ‘’ Brother their is a evil coyote, can you let me in.’’ The mice let him in. The mice was eaten up by the coyote‘’ I knew that would work.’’ The fifth mice built a house of stone. The big bad coyote thought what to do ‘’ I know, I will change my look.’’ He changed his outfit into a jacket and tan bandanna. He went to the house and said ‘’ Little mice, can you let me in’’ the mice looked up and down and said no. The coyote exclaimed’’ I will make you a deal, join my side or I eat you up.’’ The mice said ‘’ I would never work with a beast’’ and got eaten up. The six mice built a house of iron. The coyote came and said ‘’ Little mice, can you let me eat you up’’ and got a no for a answer. He burnt the house down. The last mice the smartest built a house of steel. The coyote came slightly burnt. He said tired ‘’ Little mice I want to speak to you’’ the mice said ‘’ Not by the tail on my back am I letting you in.’’ The coyote ran out of breath. So he couldn’t try anything else on the house. The mice lived peacefully for now.
Once upon a time, there was a young and innocent Arabian princess named Raechachi.
WE INTERRUPT THIS FAIRYTALE FOR A VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT!This just in:  It is the year 1989.  There aren’t any more happy endings – people die.  The princess is not always rescued from the evil queen or villain by Prince Charming.  We are in the 20th century now.  There are such things as the ERA and women’s lib.WE NOW RETURN YOU TO YOUR IRREGULAR FAIRYTALE.
She was a smart girl, though, and lifted weights.  She was on her way to becoming the female weight-lifting champion of the world.  Not only this, she was an expert fencer.
One day, she received a letter from five Iranian terrorists who had taken her boyfriend, Prince (and soon to be King) Harning as hostage.  They demanded twenty zillion notes or they would kill him.
Raechachi was not going to stand for it.  Prince Harning’s parents were going to send the money with a special ink on it so they could locate the villains and retrieve their money.  The ink would be found with a special magical detector the court magician could make, and only he could detect the ink.  Raechachi decided that she would be the one to hand over the twenty zillion notes to stall for time, and then go save her Prince.
The day came when the money was supposed to be delivered.  Raechachi followed all the instructions, but the kidnappers decided they wanted still more money before they would return Prince Harning unharmed.  The really made Princess Raechachi fumed.
She had located the hideout of the kidnappers (an abandoned castle) with the help of her magician, and set out right away to save her prince in distress.  She got on her horse and rode out to save her love.
On the way there, a bridge that connected two cliffs had fallen.  The only way to save Prince Harning in time was to cross that bridge, but it was only connected to the other cliff.  The ropes weren’t connected to the cliff that she was on.  The bridge was in the valley between the cliffs, and no one would be able to fix it until next month when the kingdom’s traveling handymen would come there.
Raechachi took matters into her own hands.  She went to her saddle bags and pulled out all of the ropes.  She connected them all to a large metal hook-like ting she used for climbing mountains.  She threw down the rope and hook to the fallen bridge.
Soon she had caught the bridge on the hook and prepared to reel it in.  Since Raechachi could lift five hundred pounds, she could fix the bridge with a little help.  She put on her gloves, picked up her makeshift fishing line, and tied it to the horn on her stallion’s saddle.  She and the horse pulled.  In about twenty minutes the bridge was in place.
The princess secured the bridge, then walked across it to the other side.  But, little did she know her adventures had just begun.
About two miles away from the hideout, the horse decided he was tired.  Raechachi tried and tried to get him to move.  She couldn’t go fast enough without her horse.  After a few minutes struggling with the stallion, he moved.  Raechachi mounted him again and set off once more to release her beloved prince from the bonds of the abductors.
After all that had happened in the past few hours, things seemed to be running smoothly, but the princess knew that it was too good to be true.So when the guard to the kidnapper’s hideout jumped on Raechachi’s stallion, she was ready.  Instead of panicking, she elbowed him off her horse.  She galloped the rest of the way to the door of the castle and jumped off her horse, tying the reins her special way so that she, and only she, could unknot them.
The door was locked.  She was just about to pick the lock with a hairpin, but that guard had caught up with her.  He was armed with a sword.  He didn’t know that the princess was an expert – no, a champion – at fencing.
Raechachi caught sight of him and grabbed one of the decorative swords hanging on the door.  From there, it was a battle to the death.  As just about everyone knows, in fairytales the good side always triumphs over the bad.  So, of course, Raechachi won.  She stabbed the guard with the sword, and came out with a chipped nail.
She picked the lock before anyone could come and look for the guard.  In five seconds, she found the room her beloved prince was locked in.  He had his own plans of escape:  a very strong sheet ladder that would go out the window and down the castle wall.  Raechachi and her fiancé climbed down the ladder and onto the ground.  It was dark outside, with a brightly glowing moon and a sky full of stars.
As soon as she untied her stallion, Raechachi and Prince Harning rode off into the night on her white stallion.
The End?

Greek Mythology is the set of stories
about the gods,
goddesses,
heroes and
rituals of
Ancient
Greeks.

Aphrodite is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by few of her children, the Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both mortals and gods at the goddess’ will. Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam (aphros) Uranus' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to Hephaestus, she had affairs with all Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of war. She also had famous romances with two mortals, Anchises and Adonis.
Apollo is the Olympian god of light, music and poetry, healing and plagues, prophecy and knowledge, order and beauty, archery and agriculture. An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of kalokagathia, he is harmony, reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical superiority and moral virtue. A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often as Zeus himself, Apollo is the only major god who appears with the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology.
Ares is the Olympian god of war. However, unlike Athena, he represents merely its destructive capacity and is typically the personification of sheer violence and brutality. Consequently, he was loved neither by gods nor by men. That is, with the exception of Aphrodite, who bore him many children out of wedlock.
Artemis is the Olympian goddess of the hunt, the moon, and chastity; in time, she also became associated with childbirth and nature. No more than few days old, she helped her mother Leto give birth to her twin brother Apollo. Artemis was very protective of her and her priestesses’ innocence. Consequently, she wasn’t very nice when some of them weren’t so careful.
Athena is the Olympian goddess of wisdom and war and the adored patroness of the city of Athens. A virgin deity, she was also – somewhat paradoxically – associated with peace and handicrafts, especially spinning and weaving. Majestic and stern, Athena surpassed everybody in both of her main domains. In fact, even Ares feared her; and all Greek heroes asked her for help and advice.
Hades is the Ancient Greek god of the Underworld, the place where human souls go after death. In time, his name became synonymous with his realm. It has to be said unsurprisingly – since he barely left it. Appropriately, the most significant myth related to Hades concerns one of the very few times he did – to abduct Demeter’s daughter, Persephone.
Hephaestus is the god of blacksmiths and fire. Called “the celestial artificer,” he was also associated with other craftsmen (sculptors, carpenters, metalworkers) and, as evident in the name of his Roman counterpart Vulcan, with volcanoes. Even though an ugly god lamed by his own mother, he was the husband of none other than Aphrodite herself.
Hera is the wife of Zeus, the Queen of Olympus, and the Olympian goddess of marriage. As such, she is also the deity most associated with family and the welfare of women and children. Her marriage, however, was an unhappy one, since Zeus had numerous affairs. Jealous and vengeful, Hera made sure to give each of his consorts some hard time.
Hermes is the winged herald and messenger of the Olympian gods. In addition, he is also a divine trickster, and the god of roads, flocks, commerce, and thieves. A precocious newborn, he invented the lyre and stole Apollo’s cattle on the very first day of his life. Hermes was the only Olympian capable of crossing the border between the living and the dead.
Hestia is the Greek goddess of the hearth, one of the original Twelve Olympians. Cronus’ and Rhea’s first-born child, she was pure and peaceful. However, since she always had to stay at home, tending the fireplace, Hestia is not involved in many myths. Consequently, at a later stage, she would be replaced in the Pantheon with the much wilder Dionysus.
Poseidon is the violent and ill-tempered god of the sea. One of the Twelve Olympians, he was also feared as the provoker of earthquakes and worshipped as the creator of the horse. A hot-blooded deity, Poseidon had many disputes with both gods and men, most famously with Athena and Odysseus.
Zeus is the Olympian god of the sky and the thunder, the king of all other gods and men, and, consequently, the chief figure in Greek mythology. The son of Cronus and Rhea, he is probably most famous for his infidelity to his sister and wife, Hera.  Athena, Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, and the Muses are all children of his numerous erotic affairs. Hephaestus, Hebe, and Ares are his legitimate children. 
In Greek mythology, the Olympians were the major deities who Ancient Greeks believed in. The Olympians were twelve and comprised of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes and either Hestia or Dionysus. Their name, Olympians, originates from Mount Olympus, which was their place of residence; therefore, although sometimes Hades and Persephone were included in the Olympians, they should be excluded in the sense that they lived in the underworld.
Asteria was a name given to a number of different beings in Greek mythology.
Astraeus is a revered Titan god in Greek mythology, embodying the celestial elements of stars and astrology. As the progeny of Crius and Eurybia, Astraeus represents the intricate connection between the heavens and the earthly realm. His union with Eos, the goddess of the dawn, signifies the harmonious blend of light and darkness, marking the transition from night to day.
Atlas was one of the most famous Titans, the son of Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia (or, possibly, Clymene). He was the leader of the Titan rebellion against Zeus, and he got a fitting punishment after the end of the Titanomachy: he was condemned to eternally hold up the sky. Only once, and for a very brief period, he was bereaved of this burden by Heracles. Perseus, probably using Medusa’s head, turned him into the stony Atlas Mountains.
Clymene was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, daughter of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, thus making her an Oceanid. She was the goddess of renown, fame, and infamy. She was married to the Titan Iapetus, and they had four sons, Atlas, Epimetheus, Prometheus and Menoetius. She was also a consort of Helios, with whom she had a son, Phaeton, and the Heliades.
Coeus was one of the Titans, son of Uranus and Gaia.
Crius was one of the Titans, son of Uranus and Gaea. He married Eurybia, daughter of Pontus and Gaea, and had three children, Astraios, Pallas and Perses.
Cronus was the youngest son of Uranus and Gaea, the leader of the first generation of Titans, and, for a brief period, the ruler of all gods and men. He successfully led the rebellion against his father, but soon grew as tyrannical as him, imprisoning both the Cyclops and the Hecatoncheires, and swallowing all of his children, save the last son; eventually, this child – Zeus – would be the one to overthrow him and lock him away in Tartarus.
Dione was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, most probably a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys and thus, an Oceanid. According to some sources, she was the first wife of Zeus, with whom she had a daughter, the goddess Aphrodite. She was an oracle and was worshipped alongside Zeus at the earliest Oracle in Greece that was located at Dodona. She made an appearance in Homer's Iliad, when her daughter was wounded and she tried to heal her. The priestesses and prophetesses at her shrine in Dodona were called Peleiades or the Doves, which was the sacred bird of her daughter, Aphrodite.
Eos is the enchanting Titan goddess of the dawn in Greek mythology, renowned for her role in opening the gates of heaven each morning to herald the arrival of her brother, Helios, the sun. Daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, and sister to Helios and Selene (the moon), Eos is often depicted with rosy fingers or golden arms, symbolizing the soft light of daybreak.
Epimetheus was one of the Titans, son of Iapetus and Clymene. He was the brother of Prometheus, Atlas and Menoetius.
Eurybia was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, representing the mastery of the seas. She was a minor deity and did not play an important role in the myths. She was the daughter of the Titans Pontus and Gaea, and she was married to the Titan Crius. Her children were Astraeus, Perses and Pallas.
Eurynome was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, daughter of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, hence an Oceanid. She was the third wife of Zeus, with whom she had the three Charites, goddesses of grace. When Hephaestus was thrown off Mount Olympus by his mother Hera for being crippled, Eurynome and Thetis caught him and raised him. Eurynome may also have been a goddess of pasturelands.

In Greek mythology, Aeolus was the Keeper of the Winds, who controlled the four winds that blew across the earth. The four winds were Boreas (the north wind), Zephyrus (the west wind), Eurus (the east wind), and Notus (the south wind). He was a son of the god of the sea, Poseidon, and was known for his great power over the winds and his ability to create storms.
Aether was one of the primordial deities in Greek mythology, the son of the primordial deities Erebus (darkness) and Nyx (night), or according to Orphic Hymns, Chronos (time) and Ananke (necessity). He was the brother of Hemera (day), and according to some sources, he fathered Gaea (earth), Thalassa (sea) and Uranus (heavens). He was the personification of the upper air that only gods breathe, as opposed to the normal air breathed by mortals. The air encircling the mortal world was called Chaos or Aer, while the Underworld where the dead dwelled was enveloped in Erebos, the mist of darkness.
Amphitrite was one of the sea nymphs Nereids, fifty sisters in total and daughters of Nereus and Doris. She was the wife of Poseidon and had two children with him; a son named Triton, a merman; and Rhode. Amphitrite also gave birth to other children, such as seals and dolphins. Initially, she was considered an important deity, as mentioned in the Homeric Hymn, when she was present at the birth of Apollo, alongside Dione, Rhea and Themis. Gradually, she became less important and in the end, the poets used her name as a mere representation of the sea. Her Roman counterpart was Salacia, the goddess of saltwater.
The Anemoi were the four wind gods in Greek mythology, each of them corresponding to one of the four cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) from which they came. They were the children of Aeolus, the Keeper of the Winds, and Eos, the Titan goddess of the dawn. The four gods were Boreas (North Wind), Notus (South Wind), Zephyrus (West Wind) and Eurus (East Wind).
Apate was a deity in Greek mythology, the personification of deceit. Her mother was Nyx, the primordial goddess of night, and her father was Erebos, the personification of darkness. She was the sister of Geras (old age), Oizys (suffering), Moros (doom), Momos (blame), Eris (strife), Nemesis (retribution) and Keres (carnage and violent death). When the box of Pandora was opened, Apate was one of the evil spirits that came out of it. Her male counterpart was Dolos.
Asclepius was the ancient Greek god of medicine, son of the god Apollo and Coronis, the daughter of Phlegyas, King of the Lapiths. He was married to Epione, the goddess of soothing; together, they had a number of children; their daughters were Panacea (goddess of medicines), Hygeia (goddess of health), Iaso (goddess of recuperation), Aceso (goddess of the healing process), Aglaea or Aegle (goddess of magnificence and splendor). They also had four sons; Machaon and Podalirius were legendary healers who fought in the Trojan War; Telesphorus who accompanied his sister, Hygeia, and symbolised recuperation; and Aratus.
Aura was a deity that represented the gentle breeze of the early morning. It appeared both in Greek and Roman mythology. She was the daughter of Lelantos and Periboa. It is also said that Aurae were similar to ghosts, having the ability to disappear into the air.
Bia was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, daughter of the Titans Pallas and Styx, and had three siblings; Nike, Kratos, and Zelus. Bia was the personification of force. During the Titanomachy, the war between the Titans and the Olympians out of which the latter emerged victorious, Bia and her siblings sided with Zeus, along with Styx. To honour them, Zeus made the four siblings his constant companions.
Chaos was – most Greek cosmologies tell us – the very first of all, the origin of everything, the empty, unfathomable space at the beginning of time. But, it was more than just a gaping void – as its name is usually translated from Ancient Greek. Personified as a female, Chaos was the primal feature of the universe, a shadowy realm of mass and energy from which much of what is powerful (and mostly negative and dark) in the world would stem forth in later genealogies.
The daughter of Helios and Perse, Circe was a powerful enchantress versatile in the arts of herbs and potions and capable of turning human beings into animals. She did just that to Odysseus’ sailors when they reached her dwelling place, the secluded island of Aeaea. Odysseus, however, managed to trick her with the help of Hermes and, instead of becoming an animal, he became her lover for a year. The couple had three children, one of whom, Telegonus, eventually killed Odysseus.
Deimos was a god in Greek mythology, personification of terror (his name meant "dread"). He was the son of gods Ares and Aphrodite, and had a twin brother, Phobos ("fear"). He did not appear in any stories in Greek mythology, but he was a mere representation of the terror that is brought upon humans by war.
Demeter, the middle daughter of Cronus and Rhea, was the Ancient Greek goddess of grain and agriculture, one of the original Twelve Olympians. Her grief over her daughter Persephone – who has to spend one-third of the year with her husband Hades in the Underworld – is the reason why there is winter; her joy when she gets her back coincides with the fertile spring and summer months. Demeter and Persephone were the central figures of the Eleusinian Mysteries, the most famous secret religious festival in Ancient Greece.

A host of Legendary Creatures, animals and mythic humanoids occur in ancient Greek Mythology.

For anyone who loves a great story, Greek mythology provides some of the richest material around. With tales of gods and goddesses, heroic mortals, and fabulous creatures, these ancient myths have fired the imaginations of storytellers for centuries. And they've also found their way to the big screen on more than one occasion.
Norse mythology is the name we give to the set of beliefs and stories that the Viking people told about their gods and goddesses, and the adventures they had in the nine worlds. The Vikings were people who lived in Northern Europe a long time ago, and they loved to explore and trade with other lands. They also loved to tell stories and poems about their gods and goddesses, who had amazing powers and personalities. The Vikings did not have a book or a scripture to write down their stories, but they passed them on from one generation to the next by speaking and singing.

For the ancient Greeks (before the age of telescopes) the night sky was thought to consist of two very similar components: fixed stars, which remained motionless in relation to each other, and "wandering stars" (Ancient Greek: asteres planet-ai), which moved relative to the fixed stars over the course of the year.

Often described as the father of tragedy by both Ancient Greek authors and modern scholars, Aeschylus is the earliest playwright whose works have survived to this day and age. Born into a well-to-do family at Eleusis in 525/4 BC, he debuted on the stage in the twenty-sixth year of his life, but achieved his first victory only fifteen years later, in 484. However, after this triumph, he was probably victorious almost every time he competed at the City Dionysia until his death, eventually amassing no less than 13 wins, a feat surpassed only by his younger contemporary Sophocles (24). Only seven out of the 70 to 90 plays he is supposed to have written during his life have survived: Persians, Seven Against Thebes, Suppliants, Agamemnon, Libation Bearers, Eumenides, and Prometheus Bound. Agamemnon, Libation Bearers and Eumenides constitute a single story and are part of a trilogy called the Oresteia, which is the only ancient example of this form to have reached us. Oresteia might have been Aeschylus last play because soon after producing it he left (for the second time) to Sicily, where he died in 456/5 BC. Interestingly enough, the inscription on Aeschylus’ gravestone commemorates only his military achievements and makes no mention of his status as the foremost playwright of his day and age.
Routinely described as “the father of comedy” and “the greatest ancient comic writer,” Aristophanes was born in the early 440s, most probably in 447/6. He debuted barely out of his teenage years with The Banqueters in 427 BC (now lost), and won the first prize at both the Dionysia and the Lenaea with his following two plays: The Babylonians and The Acharnians. Unfortunately, his attack on some of the Athenian customs caught the eye of the most powerful politician of the day, Cleon, who denounced him before the Athenian council. Instead of backing down, Aristophanes went on attacking Cleon incessantly – even after the politician died in 422 BC. He practically dominated the 420s with no less than seven prizes, but he seems to have enjoyed fewer successes afterward: we don’t hear of an Aristophanic victory before 405 BC when he produced The Frogs. The play was reperformed by civic decree the very next year, but this might have been a political maneuver by the Thirty Oligarchs, a pro-Spartan coalition that came to power in Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War. A conservative, Aristophanes may have even sided with them, but even if that was the case, he reclaimed his reputation afterward and won first prizes with some of his last plays: the surviving Wealth and the lost Cocalus. All in all, he seems to have written about 40 comedies, of which 11 survive to this day. They are all examples of a style called Old Comedy, but it can be argued that Wealth is already a Middle Comedy play, and, based on what we know, Cocalus may have anticipated almost all of the elements typical for New Comedy. Innovative until the very end, Aristophanes is practically the only Ancient comic author that can be studied more closely today. Even though already in Antiquity, Aristophanes’ fame was eclipsed by that of the New Comedy author Menander, all but one of Menander’s plays were somehow lost during the Middle Ages. In spite of their topicality and choral style, one-fourth of Aristophanes’ comedies survived – and most of them are regularly performed and adapted throughout the world today.
Born (most probably) in 480 BC, the year of the Battle of Salamis, in the eastern suburbs of Athens, Euripides was the last and most rebellious of the three great Ancient Greek tragedians. He debuted in the year of Aeschylus’ death (455) and won his first victory 14 years later with an unknown tragedy. He won the first prize three more times during his life, and once posthumously – with a tetralogy produced either by his son or nephew named Euripides that included Iphigenia in Aulis, Alcmaeon and Bacchae. Most probably, all of these plays were written at the court of King Archelaus of Macedon, where Euripides was either exiled or chose to retire soon after producing Orestes in 408. Even though most ancient sources ascribe 92 plays to Euripides’ name, 4 of them seem to have been dubious even to ancient scholars. Out of the remaining 88, 14 were probably lost even when the Alexandrian librarians decided to catalogue them in the third century BC, and only 19 have survived complete to this day. One of these (Rhesus) is spurious, one (Iphigenia in Aulis) was certainly left unfinished by Euripides, and a third one (Cyclops) is the only complete satyr-play to reach us in entirety. Even though Euripides wasn’t very successful during his lifetime—he won 8 victories less than Aeschylus and 13 less than Sophocles—the very things that might have made him unpopular in fifth-century Athens (his skepticism and unconventionality, as well as his conceivably radical views on war, religion and patriarchy) resonate loudly with audiences today, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he is considered the most modern and most individualistic of all three great tragedians.
Though Aeschylus was considered “the father of tragedy” by almost everybody in the ancient world, Sophocles was generally more loved, and his plays were often considered a better specimen of the genre. Born into a wealthy family at Colonus just a few years before the battle of Marathon (most probably 496 BC), Sophocles debuted at the City Dionysia in 468 BC and, according to Plutarch, immediately turned the attention to himself, triumphing over Aeschylus, for years the sovereign ruler of the Ancient Greek stage. After the death of his predecessor (456/5 BC), Sophocles became the preeminent playwright in Athens, a title he held onto for the next half a century, practically until his very death at the age of 90 in the winter of 406/5 BC. During this period, Sophocles is said to have authored over 120 plays, only seven of which survive to this day in their entirety: Antigone, Ajax, Women of Trachis, Oedipus Rex, Electra, Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus. Ancient sources claim that Sophocles competed 30 times at the tragic festivals and that 24 times he won the first prize; he was placed second the other six. Even while still alive, Sophocles came to be regarded as one of the wisest men in all of Greece, and soon after his death authors such as Aristophanes and Phrynichus paid warm tributes to him, paving the way for the subsequent canonization of both his name and his oeuvre.
Greek Plays
Aphrodite is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by few of her children, the Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both mortals and gods at the goddess’ will. Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam (aphros) Uranus' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to Hephaestus, she had affairs with all Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of war. She also had famous romances with two mortals, Anchises and Adonis.
Apollo is the Olympian god of light, music and poetry, healing and plagues, prophecy and knowledge, order and beauty, archery and agriculture. An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of kalokagathia, he is harmony, reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical superiority and moral virtue. A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often as Zeus himself, Apollo is the only major god who appears with the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology.
Ares is the Olympian god of war. However, unlike Athena, he represents merely its destructive capacity and is typically the personification of sheer violence and brutality. Consequently, he was loved neither by gods nor by men. That is, with the exception of Aphrodite, who bore him many children out of wedlock.
Artemis is the Olympian goddess of the hunt, the moon, and chastity; in time, she also became associated with childbirth and nature. No more than few days old, she helped her mother Leto give birth to her twin brother Apollo. Artemis was very protective of her and her priestesses’ innocence. Consequently, she wasn’t very nice when some of them weren’t so careful.
Athena is the Olympian goddess of wisdom and war and the adored patroness of the city of Athens. A virgin deity, she was also – somewhat paradoxically – associated with peace and handicrafts, especially spinning and weaving. Majestic and stern, Athena surpassed everybody in both of her main domains. In fact, even Ares feared her; and all Greek heroes asked her for help and advice.
Hades is the Ancient Greek god of the Underworld, the place where human souls go after death. In time, his name became synonymous with his realm. It has to be said unsurprisingly – since he barely left it. Appropriately, the most significant myth related to Hades concerns one of the very few times he did – to abduct Demeter’s daughter, Persephone.
Hephaestus is the god of blacksmiths and fire. Called “the celestial artificer,” he was also associated with other craftsmen (sculptors, carpenters, metalworkers) and, as evident in the name of his Roman counterpart Vulcan, with volcanoes. Even though an ugly god lamed by his own mother, he was the husband of none other than Aphrodite herself.
Hera is the wife of Zeus, the Queen of Olympus, and the Olympian goddess of marriage. As such, she is also the deity most associated with family and the welfare of women and children. Her marriage, however, was an unhappy one, since Zeus had numerous affairs. Jealous and vengeful, Hera made sure to give each of his consorts some hard time.
Hermes is the winged herald and messenger of the Olympian gods. In addition, he is also a divine trickster, and the god of roads, flocks, commerce, and thieves. A precocious newborn, he invented the lyre and stole Apollo’s cattle on the very first day of his life. Hermes was the only Olympian capable of crossing the border between the living and the dead.
Hestia is the Greek goddess of the hearth, one of the original Twelve Olympians. Cronus’ and Rhea’s first-born child, she was pure and peaceful. However, since she always had to stay at home, tending the fireplace, Hestia is not involved in many myths. Consequently, at a later stage, she would be replaced in the Pantheon with the much wilder Dionysus.
Poseidon is the violent and ill-tempered god of the sea. One of the Twelve Olympians, he was also feared as the provoker of earthquakes and worshipped as the creator of the horse. A hot-blooded deity, Poseidon had many disputes with both gods and men, most famously with Athena and Odysseus.
Zeus is the Olympian god of the sky and the thunder, the king of all other gods and men, and, consequently, the chief figure in Greek mythology. The son of Cronus and Rhea, he is probably most famous for his infidelity to his sister and wife, Hera.  Athena, Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, and the Muses are all children of his numerous erotic affairs. Hephaestus, Hebe, and Ares are his legitimate children. 
In Greek mythology, the Olympians were the major deities who Ancient Greeks believed in. The Olympians were twelve and comprised of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes and either Hestia or Dionysus. Their name, Olympians, originates from Mount Olympus, which was their place of residence; therefore, although sometimes Hades and Persephone were included in the Olympians, they should be excluded in the sense that they lived in the underworld.
Asteria was a name given to a number of different beings in Greek mythology.
Astraeus is a revered Titan god in Greek mythology, embodying the celestial elements of stars and astrology. As the progeny of Crius and Eurybia, Astraeus represents the intricate connection between the heavens and the earthly realm. His union with Eos, the goddess of the dawn, signifies the harmonious blend of light and darkness, marking the transition from night to day.
Atlas was one of the most famous Titans, the son of Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia (or, possibly, Clymene). He was the leader of the Titan rebellion against Zeus, and he got a fitting punishment after the end of the Titanomachy: he was condemned to eternally hold up the sky. Only once, and for a very brief period, he was bereaved of this burden by Heracles. Perseus, probably using Medusa’s head, turned him into the stony Atlas Mountains.
Clymene was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, daughter of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, thus making her an Oceanid. She was the goddess of renown, fame, and infamy. She was married to the Titan Iapetus, and they had four sons, Atlas, Epimetheus, Prometheus and Menoetius. She was also a consort of Helios, with whom she had a son, Phaeton, and the Heliades.
Coeus was one of the Titans, son of Uranus and Gaia.
Crius was one of the Titans, son of Uranus and Gaea. He married Eurybia, daughter of Pontus and Gaea, and had three children, Astraios, Pallas and Perses.
Cronus was the youngest son of Uranus and Gaea, the leader of the first generation of Titans, and, for a brief period, the ruler of all gods and men. He successfully led the rebellion against his father, but soon grew as tyrannical as him, imprisoning both the Cyclops and the Hecatoncheires, and swallowing all of his children, save the last son; eventually, this child – Zeus – would be the one to overthrow him and lock him away in Tartarus.
Dione was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, most probably a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys and thus, an Oceanid. According to some sources, she was the first wife of Zeus, with whom she had a daughter, the goddess Aphrodite. She was an oracle and was worshipped alongside Zeus at the earliest Oracle in Greece that was located at Dodona. She made an appearance in Homer's Iliad, when her daughter was wounded and she tried to heal her. The priestesses and prophetesses at her shrine in Dodona were called Peleiades or the Doves, which was the sacred bird of her daughter, Aphrodite.
Eos is the enchanting Titan goddess of the dawn in Greek mythology, renowned for her role in opening the gates of heaven each morning to herald the arrival of her brother, Helios, the sun. Daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, and sister to Helios and Selene (the moon), Eos is often depicted with rosy fingers or golden arms, symbolizing the soft light of daybreak.
Epimetheus was one of the Titans, son of Iapetus and Clymene. He was the brother of Prometheus, Atlas and Menoetius.
Eurybia was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, representing the mastery of the seas. She was a minor deity and did not play an important role in the myths. She was the daughter of the Titans Pontus and Gaea, and she was married to the Titan Crius. Her children were Astraeus, Perses and Pallas.
Eurynome was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, daughter of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, hence an Oceanid. She was the third wife of Zeus, with whom she had the three Charites, goddesses of grace. When Hephaestus was thrown off Mount Olympus by his mother Hera for being crippled, Eurynome and Thetis caught him and raised him. Eurynome may also have been a goddess of pasturelands.

In Greek mythology, Aeolus was the Keeper of the Winds, who controlled the four winds that blew across the earth. The four winds were Boreas (the north wind), Zephyrus (the west wind), Eurus (the east wind), and Notus (the south wind). He was a son of the god of the sea, Poseidon, and was known for his great power over the winds and his ability to create storms.
Aether was one of the primordial deities in Greek mythology, the son of the primordial deities Erebus (darkness) and Nyx (night), or according to Orphic Hymns, Chronos (time) and Ananke (necessity). He was the brother of Hemera (day), and according to some sources, he fathered Gaea (earth), Thalassa (sea) and Uranus (heavens). He was the personification of the upper air that only gods breathe, as opposed to the normal air breathed by mortals. The air encircling the mortal world was called Chaos or Aer, while the Underworld where the dead dwelled was enveloped in Erebos, the mist of darkness.
Amphitrite was one of the sea nymphs Nereids, fifty sisters in total and daughters of Nereus and Doris. She was the wife of Poseidon and had two children with him; a son named Triton, a merman; and Rhode. Amphitrite also gave birth to other children, such as seals and dolphins. Initially, she was considered an important deity, as mentioned in the Homeric Hymn, when she was present at the birth of Apollo, alongside Dione, Rhea and Themis. Gradually, she became less important and in the end, the poets used her name as a mere representation of the sea. Her Roman counterpart was Salacia, the goddess of saltwater.
The Anemoi were the four wind gods in Greek mythology, each of them corresponding to one of the four cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) from which they came. They were the children of Aeolus, the Keeper of the Winds, and Eos, the Titan goddess of the dawn. The four gods were Boreas (North Wind), Notus (South Wind), Zephyrus (West Wind) and Eurus (East Wind).
Apate was a deity in Greek mythology, the personification of deceit. Her mother was Nyx, the primordial goddess of night, and her father was Erebos, the personification of darkness. She was the sister of Geras (old age), Oizys (suffering), Moros (doom), Momos (blame), Eris (strife), Nemesis (retribution) and Keres (carnage and violent death). When the box of Pandora was opened, Apate was one of the evil spirits that came out of it. Her male counterpart was Dolos.
Asclepius was the ancient Greek god of medicine, son of the god Apollo and Coronis, the daughter of Phlegyas, King of the Lapiths. He was married to Epione, the goddess of soothing; together, they had a number of children; their daughters were Panacea (goddess of medicines), Hygeia (goddess of health), Iaso (goddess of recuperation), Aceso (goddess of the healing process), Aglaea or Aegle (goddess of magnificence and splendor). They also had four sons; Machaon and Podalirius were legendary healers who fought in the Trojan War; Telesphorus who accompanied his sister, Hygeia, and symbolised recuperation; and Aratus.
Aura was a deity that represented the gentle breeze of the early morning. It appeared both in Greek and Roman mythology. She was the daughter of Lelantos and Periboa. It is also said that Aurae were similar to ghosts, having the ability to disappear into the air.
Bia was a Titan goddess in Greek mythology, daughter of the Titans Pallas and Styx, and had three siblings; Nike, Kratos, and Zelus. Bia was the personification of force. During the Titanomachy, the war between the Titans and the Olympians out of which the latter emerged victorious, Bia and her siblings sided with Zeus, along with Styx. To honour them, Zeus made the four siblings his constant companions.
Chaos was – most Greek cosmologies tell us – the very first of all, the origin of everything, the empty, unfathomable space at the beginning of time. But, it was more than just a gaping void – as its name is usually translated from Ancient Greek. Personified as a female, Chaos was the primal feature of the universe, a shadowy realm of mass and energy from which much of what is powerful (and mostly negative and dark) in the world would stem forth in later genealogies.
The daughter of Helios and Perse, Circe was a powerful enchantress versatile in the arts of herbs and potions and capable of turning human beings into animals. She did just that to Odysseus’ sailors when they reached her dwelling place, the secluded island of Aeaea. Odysseus, however, managed to trick her with the help of Hermes and, instead of becoming an animal, he became her lover for a year. The couple had three children, one of whom, Telegonus, eventually killed Odysseus.
Deimos was a god in Greek mythology, personification of terror (his name meant "dread"). He was the son of gods Ares and Aphrodite, and had a twin brother, Phobos ("fear"). He did not appear in any stories in Greek mythology, but he was a mere representation of the terror that is brought upon humans by war.
Demeter, the middle daughter of Cronus and Rhea, was the Ancient Greek goddess of grain and agriculture, one of the original Twelve Olympians. Her grief over her daughter Persephone – who has to spend one-third of the year with her husband Hades in the Underworld – is the reason why there is winter; her joy when she gets her back coincides with the fertile spring and summer months. Demeter and Persephone were the central figures of the Eleusinian Mysteries, the most famous secret religious festival in Ancient Greece.

A host of Legendary Creatures, animals and mythic humanoids occur in ancient Greek Mythology.

For anyone who loves a great story, Greek mythology provides some of the richest material around. With tales of gods and goddesses, heroic mortals, and fabulous creatures, these ancient myths have fired the imaginations of storytellers for centuries. And they've also found their way to the big screen on more than one occasion.
Norse mythology is the name we give to the set of beliefs and stories that the Viking people told about their gods and goddesses, and the adventures they had in the nine worlds. The Vikings were people who lived in Northern Europe a long time ago, and they loved to explore and trade with other lands. They also loved to tell stories and poems about their gods and goddesses, who had amazing powers and personalities. The Vikings did not have a book or a scripture to write down their stories, but they passed them on from one generation to the next by speaking and singing.

For the ancient Greeks (before the age of telescopes) the night sky was thought to consist of two very similar components: fixed stars, which remained motionless in relation to each other, and "wandering stars" (Ancient Greek: asteres planet-ai), which moved relative to the fixed stars over the course of the year.

Often described as the father of tragedy by both Ancient Greek authors and modern scholars, Aeschylus is the earliest playwright whose works have survived to this day and age. Born into a well-to-do family at Eleusis in 525/4 BC, he debuted on the stage in the twenty-sixth year of his life, but achieved his first victory only fifteen years later, in 484. However, after this triumph, he was probably victorious almost every time he competed at the City Dionysia until his death, eventually amassing no less than 13 wins, a feat surpassed only by his younger contemporary Sophocles (24). Only seven out of the 70 to 90 plays he is supposed to have written during his life have survived: Persians, Seven Against Thebes, Suppliants, Agamemnon, Libation Bearers, Eumenides, and Prometheus Bound. Agamemnon, Libation Bearers and Eumenides constitute a single story and are part of a trilogy called the Oresteia, which is the only ancient example of this form to have reached us. Oresteia might have been Aeschylus last play because soon after producing it he left (for the second time) to Sicily, where he died in 456/5 BC. Interestingly enough, the inscription on Aeschylus’ gravestone commemorates only his military achievements and makes no mention of his status as the foremost playwright of his day and age.
Routinely described as “the father of comedy” and “the greatest ancient comic writer,” Aristophanes was born in the early 440s, most probably in 447/6. He debuted barely out of his teenage years with The Banqueters in 427 BC (now lost), and won the first prize at both the Dionysia and the Lenaea with his following two plays: The Babylonians and The Acharnians. Unfortunately, his attack on some of the Athenian customs caught the eye of the most powerful politician of the day, Cleon, who denounced him before the Athenian council. Instead of backing down, Aristophanes went on attacking Cleon incessantly – even after the politician died in 422 BC. He practically dominated the 420s with no less than seven prizes, but he seems to have enjoyed fewer successes afterward: we don’t hear of an Aristophanic victory before 405 BC when he produced The Frogs. The play was reperformed by civic decree the very next year, but this might have been a political maneuver by the Thirty Oligarchs, a pro-Spartan coalition that came to power in Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War. A conservative, Aristophanes may have even sided with them, but even if that was the case, he reclaimed his reputation afterward and won first prizes with some of his last plays: the surviving Wealth and the lost Cocalus.

Greek Plays

Greek Mythology is the set of stories
about the gods,
goddesses,
heroes and
rituals of
Ancient
Greeks.


Heroes in Greek Mythology were men or women of special strength, courage, or ability. They were often of divine ancestry and noted for superhuman courageous acts.

Zeus is the Olympian god of the sky and the thunder, the king of all other gods and men, and, consequently, the chief figure in Greek mythology. The son of Cronus and Rhea, he is probably most famous for his infidelity to his sister and wife, Hera.  Athena, Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, and the Muses are all children of his numerous erotic affairs. Hephaestus, Hebe, and Ares are his legitimate children. 
Poseidon is the violent and ill-tempered god of the sea. One of the Twelve Olympians, he was also feared as the provoker of earthquakes and worshipped as the creator of the horse. A hot-blooded deity, Poseidon had many disputes with both gods and men, most famously with Athena and Odysseus.
Apollo is the Olympian god of light, music and poetry, healing and plagues, prophecy and knowledge, order and beauty, archery and agriculture. An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of kalokagathia, he is harmony, reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical superiority and moral virtue. A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often as Zeus himself, Apollo is the only major god who appears with the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology.
Aphrodite is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by few of her children, the Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both mortals and gods at the goddess’ will. Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam (aphros) Uranus' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to Hephaestus, she had affairs with all Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of war. She also had famous romances with two mortals, Anchises and Adonis.
Hera is the wife of Zeus, the Queen of Olympus, and the Olympian goddess of marriage. As such, she is also the deity most associated with family and the welfare of women and children. Her marriage, however, was an unhappy one, since Zeus had numerous affairs. Jealous and vengeful, Hera made sure to give each of his consorts some hard time.
Athena is the Olympian goddess of wisdom and war and the adored patroness of the city of Athens. A virgin deity, she was also – somewhat paradoxically – associated with peace and handicrafts, especially spinning and weaving. Majestic and stern, Athena surpassed everybody in both of her main domains. In fact, even Ares feared her; and all Greek heroes asked her for help and advice.

Atlas was one of the most famous Titans, the son of Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia (or, possibly, Clymene). He was the leader of the Titan rebellion against Zeus, and he got a fitting punishment after the end of the Titanomachy: he was condemned to eternally hold up the sky. Only once, and for a very brief period, he was bereaved of this burden by Heracles. Perseus, probably using Medusa’s head, turned him into the stony Atlas Mountains.
In Greek mythology, the Olympians were the major deities who Ancient Greeks believed in. The Olympians were twelve and comprised of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes and either Hestia or Dionysus. Their name, Olympians, originates from Mount Olympus, which was their place of residence; therefore, although sometimes Hades and Persephone were included in the Olympians, they should be excluded in the sense that they lived in the underworld.

Hades is the Ancient Greek god of the Underworld, the place where human souls go after death. In time, his name became synonymous with his realm. It has to be said unsurprisingly – since he barely left it. Appropriately, the most significant myth related to Hades concerns one of the very few times he did – to abduct Demeter’s daughter, Persephone.
Hephaestus is the god of blacksmiths and fire. Called “the celestial artificer,” he was also associated with other craftsmen (sculptors, carpenters, metalworkers) and, as evident in the name of his Roman counterpart Vulcan, with volcanoes.

Menoetius was a Titan god, son of Titans Iapetus and Clymene, and brother of Atlas, Prometheus and Epimetheus.

This led to Prometheus stealing the fire from the gods and gifting it to humanity, which resulted in Zeus chaining Prometheus and sending an eagle to prey upon his continually regenerating liver. After some time, Zeus’ son Heracles shot the eagle and freed Prometheus, and the Titan subsequently made peace with his savior’s father.
